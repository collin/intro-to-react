## Setup & Launch Vite Bundler

As you go through more of these labs, you'll be repeating a lot of the same steps
to get started. In later labs fewer details will be provided. If you get stuck,
come back to the earlier labs for a reresher.

In the first lab you created your own `index.html` and `main.jsx` files. In this lab,
equivalent files area already provided in your solution folder.

To get started, we're going to need a terminal to build and serve our react code.

A quick way to get a terminal open is to right click on `labs/02-to-jsx-or-not/your-solution` in the VSCode file explorer and click "Open in Integrated Terminal"

<img class="mw-500 center" src={openTerminal} />

You should see something like this:

<img class="mw-500 center" src={openedTerminal} />

In that terminal, start the vite dev server.

```zsh
npx vite dev
```

You should see this output indicating vite is bundling and serving your code. Open the url it provides in your browser.

<img class="mw-500 center" src={viteStarted} />

If you open that page, and open your browser's dev tools...

<Goal>
  You've successfully started a vite dev server and loaded the starter html.

  <sub>Remember, in future labs you'll be expected to navigate this step on your own.</sub>
